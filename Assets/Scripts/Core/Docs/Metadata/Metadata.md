# Metadata

## TL;DR

- Metadata is basically any kind of additional information that you want to add to some stuff without changing it or introducing any kind of constraints on what data it should hold
- You can apply metadata basically to anything. All you need is a wrapper class that contains both the value and the metadata object repository
- Metadata is entirely optional and allows you to fine tune what kind of additional information should an object hold
- Metadata is resolved by interface type to metadata class instance
